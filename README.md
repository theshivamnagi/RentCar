**Here’s a brief description of the system:**
Java: The system is developed using Java, a robust, object-oriented programming language that ensures platform independence, security, and reliability. Java’s extensive libraries and APIs provide the necessary tools to build a complex and efficient system.

**Apache NetBeans IDE:** This is the integrated development environment used for writing, debugging, and compiling the Java code. NetBeans provides a clean and intuitive interface, making it easier to manage large codebases and numerous project files.

**XAMPP**: XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package, which includes Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in PHP and Perl. In this system, XAMPP is used to manage the database where all the information about the cars, rentals, and customers is stored.

**Localhost Server:** The system runs on a localhost server, meaning it’s hosted and accessed on the same device. This is ideal for development and testing, as it allows developers to test the system in a controlled environment before deployment.

The system would typically include features like car inventory management, customer management, rental management, billing, and reporting. It would provide an intuitive user interface for employees to check car availability, manage rentals, and handle customer inquiries. On the other hand, it would also offer a customer-facing interface where customers can view available cars, book rentals, and make payments.

Overall, this Car Rental Management System is a powerful tool that streamlines the operations of a car rental business, making it more efficient and customer-friendly. It’s a great example of how technology can transform traditional business models.
